# Energy-Islands-Issue-Atlas

The case material is intended as a teaching resource for the analysis of sociotechnical controversies. It is constructed as an issue atlas, a concept derived from Science & Technology Studies, and allows students to follow how concerns are raised by actors over time. Besides this report, which provides background information on the case, explains the methods used, and presents key features of the data, the atlas contains:

- A dataset of actor statements, with metadata, issue classification  and semantic analysis, available as both csv and markdown
- A set of Python notebooks for searching, filtering, and visualizing  the corpus, available as both ipynb and in Google Colab.
- A set of key case documents available as pdf.
